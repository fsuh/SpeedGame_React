## Purpose of the Game

This game is for entertainment purposes only. The project is part of my school course - learning how to use React. During this project, I learnt more about state management  with class components in React. I would have loved to add features such as having different levels of difficulty, having a pictorial display of the number of lives and rounds as they decrease. That notwithstanding, I am happy with what I have learnt this far, and I will add more features as I study further.
